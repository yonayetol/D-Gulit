# Decentralized Marketplace DApp

A decentralized marketplace built on Ethereum where users can list and purchase digital items using ETH. This project demonstrates smart contract development, Web3 integration, and decentralized commerce concepts.

## Features

- **Smart Contract**: Secure marketplace contract with listing and purchasing functionality
- **Frontend**: React-based UI with MetaMask integration
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with MetaMask to interact with the marketplace
- **Item Management**: List items for sale, browse marketplace, and purchase items
- **Ownership Tracking**: On-chain ownership records for all transactions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask browser extension
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd decentralized-marketplace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm run install:frontend
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your values (for testnet deployment)
   # SEPOLIA_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
   # PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```

## Development

### Smart Contract Development

1. **Compile contracts**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

2. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Deploy to local network**
   ```bash
   # Start local Hardhat network
   npx hardhat node
   
   # In another terminal, deploy contracts
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. **Deploy to Sepolia testnet**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:sepolia
   ```

### Frontend Development

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Make sure MetaMask is installed and connected

## Usage

### For Sellers

1. **Connect your wallet** using MetaMask
2. **Navigate to "List Item"** tab
3. **Fill out the form**:
   - Item name (e.g., "Premium Study Notes")
   - Description (detailed explanation of what buyers get)
   - Price in ETH
4. **Submit the transaction** and wait for confirmation
5. **Your item is now listed** on the marketplace

### For Buyers

1. **Browse the marketplace** to see available items
2. **Click "Buy"** on any item you want to purchase
3. **Confirm the transaction** in MetaMask
4. **Wait for confirmation** - you now own the item!
5. **View your purchases** in the "My Items" tab

## Smart Contract Details

### Key Functions

- `listItem(name, description, price)`: List a new item for sale
- `purchaseItem(itemId)`: Purchase an item by paying ETH
- `getAvailableItems()`: Get all items available for purchase
- `getMyListedItems()`: Get items listed by the current user
- `getMyPurchasedItems()`: Get items purchased by the current user

### Events

- `ItemListed`: Emitted when a new item is listed
- `ItemPurchased`: Emitted when an item is purchased

### Security Features

- Price validation (must be > 0)
- Seller cannot buy their own items
- Automatic ETH transfer to seller
- Excess payment refund
- Ownership transfer tracking

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for the smart contract:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests cover:
- Contract deployment
- Item listing functionality
- Purchase functionality
- Error handling
- View functions

## Deployment

### Local Development

1. Start Hardhat network: `npx hardhat node`
2. Deploy contracts: `npm run deploy`
3. Start frontend: `npm start`

### Testnet Deployment

1. Configure `.env` with your Infura URL and private key
2. Deploy to Sepolia: `npm run deploy:sepolia`
3. Update frontend with deployed contract address
4. Build and deploy frontend: `npm run build`

## Example Items

Here are some examples of digital items you can list:

- **Study Materials**: Premium notes, exam guides, course materials
- **Digital Art**: Exclusive wallpapers, digital paintings, NFTs
